I spent my last summer in Madison, Wisconsin biking a lot. Despite having spent the past four years in Madison, this past year was my first with a bike, so I've been exploring the many paved trails that extend from downtown into the surrounding suburbs and prairies. Madison is known for its cycling trails and hospitality to bikers, but as a bikeless undergraduate I never understood why. Before getting a bike last year I was constrained to wherever I could walk downtown, most streets of which are quite busy and not particularly inviting to ride a bike on. There is one commuter path that runs through the city along an old railroad line, but it wasn't until this year that I realized it's actually outside of town where Madison's bike-friendliness shines.

Paved trails run along riverbanks, under bridges and over highways, and extend into the suburbs and beyond. Further out you can find paths that weave through prairies and clusters of trees. These are the best parts of this trail system.

The rolling prairies and cornfields of southern Wisconsin are an underappreciated landscape. Midwestern landscapes are beautiful in a quiet kind of way, one that may not be immediately breathtaking like great mountains or the ocean, but that slowly opens itself to you as you become familiar with its coneflowers, clovers and rolling wildgrasses and hills. There's a gentleness to them. They've also provided a backdrop for me as I plan out the next phase of my life during these rides.

Madison has thousands of acres of nature preserves for these trails to cross through. As this summer after college winds down and I prepare for what's next, these rides through the landscapes I've called home until this point have been reminders of the life I've known in Wisconsin. I'll soon be leaving the Midwest, but it is a beautiful place. These meandering bike rides through Madison have served as a marker of my last summer in Wisconsin, so I thought it would also be a good first post on my blog.
