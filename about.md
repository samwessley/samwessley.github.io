My name is Sam, and I'm currently learning about programming and software development with hopes of working at a software startup. Please see <a href="https://github.com/samwessley">my GitHub</a> for some stuff I've built.

I have experience with Java and Python; iOS development using Swift, XCode, C#, and Unity; and web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. I'm also interested in digital design. Recently I have been using Figma to develop the UI for a mobile puzzle game I'm building called Mesa. I also have experience with Sketch, Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

Apart from programming, Iâ€™m interested in architecture, art and design, photography, music, philosophy, health and wellness, and entrepreneurship. My goal is to incorporate some of these interests into building a startup at some point. For right now, I'm trying to learn as much as I can.
