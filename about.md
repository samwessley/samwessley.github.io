My name is Sam, and I'm currently learning about programming and software development with hopes of working at a software startup. I plan to put some of my current projects onto this site as I complete them.

I have experience with Java and Python; iOS development using Swift, XCode, C#, and Unity; and web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. I'm also interested in digital design. Recently I have been using Figma to develop the UI for a mobile puzzle game I'm building called Mesa. I also have experience with Sketch, Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

Apart from programming, Iâ€™m interested in architecture, art and design, photography, music, philosophy, health and wellness, and entrepreneurship. My goal is to incorporate some of these interests into building a startup at some point. For right now, I'm trying to learn as much as I can.

<p style="font-weight:500">I am always interested in startup jobs in San Francisco! If you have a job opportunity or for some reason would like to contact me, I would love to hear from you. Please reach out to me using the contact link above, or my email is my first and last name at gmail.</p>
